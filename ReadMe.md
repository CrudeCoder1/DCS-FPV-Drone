FPV Quadcopter Drone

Modes:
- Acro (aka Rate) [1]: The inputs control the angular rates for pitch, roll, and yaw.
- Angle [2]: The inputs control the pitch and roll angle up to a max angle (default is 50 degrees). Yaw is still angular rate.

The drone must be armed using [A] before it can fly.

Rates and angle limits can be tuned in special settings.
The bomb can be detonated using [space bar]. The bomb is not detonated on collision, only by command.
Unlimited fuel option can be used for unlimited battery life if desired.
Recomend playing with G effects off.
